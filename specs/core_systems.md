# Core Game Systems Specification

## Overview

This document details the core game systems that form the foundation of our roguelike game.

## Core Systems

### 1. Turn System

- Turn-based gameplay
- Action point system
- Turn order management
- Action scheduling

### 2. Movement System

- Grid-based movement
- Collision detection
- Path finding
- Movement costs

### 3. Field of View (FOV)

- Vision calculation
- Memory of explored areas
- Light sources
- Visibility states

### 4. Time System

- Turn management
- Action timing
- Effect duration tracking
- Event scheduling

### 5. Random Number Generation

- Deterministic RNG
- Seed management
- Distribution utilities

### 6. Event System

- Event queue
- Event handlers
- Event propagation
- Event logging

## System Interactions

### 1. Turn Resolution Flow

```
Input → Validation → Action Cost Calculation → Execute → Next Turn
```

### 2. Movement Resolution

```
Movement Input → Collision Check → FOV Update → Position Update
```

### 3. Action Resolution

```
Action Input → Validation → Resource Check → Execute → Effects → Next Turn
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Turn Management

```rust
pub struct TurnState {
    current_entity: Entity,
    action_points: i32,
    turn_number: u32,
}
```

### 2. Movement

```rust
pub struct Position {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

pub struct MovementIntent {
    target: Position,
    cost: i32,
}
```

### 3. Field of View

```rust
pub struct FieldOfView {
    visible_tiles: HashSet<Position>,
    range: i32,
    is_dirty: bool,
}
```

## System Requirements

### 1. Performance Targets

- Turn resolution < 16ms
- FOV calculation < 8ms
- Path finding < 16ms

### 2. Memory Constraints

- Efficient position storage
- Minimal state duplication
- Smart caching of calculations

### 3. Reliability

- Deterministic behavior
- Save state consistency
- Error recovery

## Integration Points

### 1. With Bevy

- System registration
- Component storage
- Resource management

### 2. With bracket-lib

- FOV calculations
- Path finding
- Random number generation

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests

- Turn resolution
- Movement validation
- FOV calculation
- Event handling

### 2. Integration Tests

- System interaction
- State consistency
- Performance benchmarks

### 3. Stress Tests

- Large maps
- Many entities
- Complex scenarios
